Repository for MLOps components

# Getting started
MLOps is conceived as a set of practices to put and monitor AI applications in production.
Based on the user requirements gathered in AI4EOSC project, we provide two tools: 
 - one focusing on experiment tracking and model registry, using MLflow Submodule: ![MLflow](https://github.com/ai4os/ai4-mlflow/tree/main)
 - one focusing on drift detection, using Frouros Submodule: ![Frouros](https://github.com/IFCA-Advanced-Computing/frouros/tree/main)
 - another one focusing on drift monitoring ![DriftWatch](https://github.com/m-team-kit/drift-watch)
